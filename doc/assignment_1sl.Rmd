This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Download dataset into the working directory
read it into R as "df"
convert "date" col into Date class
```{r, echo=TRUE}
df<-read.csv("H:/activity.csv")
df[,2] <- as.Date(df[,2])
```

1. Mean of total number steps taken per day
```{r, echo=TRUE}
total_steps_day<- tapply(df$steps, df$date, FUN = sum, na.rm=TRUE)
hist(total_steps_day, breaks=8, xlab = "Total steps taken per day")
mean(total_steps_day)
median(total_steps_day)
```
The mean is 9354.23
The median is 10395

2. Average daily activity pattern and output a figuer
```{r, echo=TRUE}
x <- as.factor(df$interval)
df <- cbind(df, x)
interval_steps <- tapply(df$steps, df$x, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
plot(interval_steps, type="l", xaxt="n")
axis(1, at=1:288,label=unique(x))
interval_steps[interval_steps == max(interval_steps)]
```
The interval with most steps in a day is 835

3.Imputing missing values
```{r,echo=TRUE}
sum(is.na(df$steps))
```
in total there are 2304 rows with NA

Process NA values in a clone dataset from dataset. NA values are replaced by mean steps per interval across all days
```{r,echo=TRUE}
df2 <- df
for(i in 1:length(df2[,1])){
        if(is.na(df2$steps[i])){df2$steps[i] <- interval_steps[df2$x[i]]}
}
```

plot histogram, calculate mean and median
```{r,echo=TRUE}
total_steps_day2<- tapply(df2$steps, df2$date, FUN = sum)
hist(total_steps_day2, breaks=8, xlab = "Total steps taken per day")
mean(total_steps_day2)
median(total_steps_day2)
```
mean: 10766.19
median: 10766.19

Processed data shows different distributions, means, and medians.

4.activity patterns between weekdays and weekends
Process df2 by adding a new factor indicating weekdays or weekends
```{r,echo=TRUE}
weekday <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
df2$days <- "weekdays"
df2[!weekdays(df2[,2]) %in% weekday, 5] <- "weekends"
df2$days <- as.factor(df2$days)
dfweekends <- split(df2,df2$days)[[2]]
dfweekdays <- split(df2,df2$days)[[1]]
interval_weekdays <- tapply(dfweekdays$steps, dfweekdays$x, mean)
interval_weekends <- tapply(dfweekends$steps, dfweekends$x, mean)
```

plot mean steps of each intervals for weekdays and weekends respectively
```{r,echo=TRUE}
plot(interval_steps, type="n", xaxt="n")
axis(1, at=1:288,label=unique(x))
lines(interval_weekdays, col="red")
lines(interval_weekends, col="blue")
legend("topleft", legend=c("weekends","weekdays"), col=c("blue","red"), lty=1)
```
